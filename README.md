# Installation

## Quick install with Google Cloud Marketplace

Get up and running with a few clicks!
Install this Conjur app to a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster using Google Cloud Marketplace.
Follow the [on-screen instructions](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/cyberark/conjur-open-source).

## Command line instructions

### Prerequisites

#### Set up command-line tools

You'll need the following tools in your development environment:
- [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/)
- [helm](https://github.com/helm/helm)
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Configure `gcloud` as a Docker credential helper:

```shell
gcloud auth configure-docker
```

#### Create a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster

Create a new cluster from the command line:

```shell
export CLUSTER=conjur-cluster
export ZONE=us-central1-a

gcloud container clusters create "$CLUSTER" --zone "$ZONE"
```

Configure `kubectl` to connect to the new cluster:

```shell
gcloud container clusters get-credentials "$CLUSTER" --zone "$ZONE"
```

#### Clone this repo

Clone this repo and the associated tools repo:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-google-cloud-marketplace.git
git submodule sync --recursive
git submodule update --recursive --init --force
```


#### Install the Application resource definition

An Application resource is a collection of individual Kubernetes components,
such as Services, Deployments, and so on, that you can manage as a group.

To set up your cluster to understand Application resources, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f marketplace-k8s-app-tools/crd/*
```

You need to run this command once.

The Application resource is defined by the
[Kubernetes SIG-apps](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps)
community. The source code can be found on
[github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application).

### Install the Application

#### Configure the app with environment variables

Choose the instance name and namespace for the app.

```shell
export APP_INSTANCE_NAME=conjur-1
export NAMESPACE=conjur
```

Configure the container images:

```shell
export IMAGE_CONJUR="marketplace.gcr.io/cyberark/conjur:latest"
export IMAGE_POSTGRES="marketplace.gcr.io/cyberark/conjur/postgres:latest"
```

The images above are referenced by
[tag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag). We recommend
that you pin each image to an immutable
[content digest](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#content-digests).
This ensures that the installed application always uses the same images,
until you are ready to upgrade. To get the digest for the image, use the
following script:

```shell
for i in "IMAGE_CONJUR" "IMAGE_POSTGRES"; do
  repo=$(echo ${!i} | cut -d: -f1);
  digest=$(docker pull ${!i} | sed -n -e 's/Digest: //p');
  export $i="$repo@$digest";
  env | grep $i;
done
```

The Conjur data key is generated by the
deployer and does not need to be created
beforehand.

#### Create namespace in your Kubernetes cluster

We recommend running Conjur in its own namespace.
If you use a different namespace than the `default`, run the command below to create a new namespace:

```shell
kubectl create namespace "$NAMESPACE"
```

#### Install the application with Helm to your Kubernetes cluster

Use `helm` to deploy the application to your Kubernetes cluster:

If you'd like to use an external database, 
use the `helm` argument `--set conjur.databaseUrl='postgresql://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]'` below. If `conjur.databaseUrl` is not specified, a postgres deployment and service are created.
See [conjur/values.yaml](conjur/values.yaml) for all available parameters and their defaults.

```shell
helm install ./conjur
```

#### View the app in the Google Cloud Console

To get the Console URL for your app, run the following command:

```shell
echo "https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/application/${ZONE}/${CLUSTER}/${NAMESPACE}/${APP_INSTANCE_NAME}"
```

To view the app, open the URL in your browser.

### Set up Conjur

To initialize Conjur, an account must be created. This is done by executing a command on a Conjur pod. This only needs to be done when launching a new Conjur application, or creating a new Conjur account.

```
# Find conjur pod
$ kubectl get po -l app=$name-conjur
conjur-d76f44b64-rkxff   1/1       Running   0          16m

# Create a Conjur account
$ kubectl exec conjur-d76f44b64-rkxff conjurctl account create quick-start
Created new account account 'quick-start'
Token-Signing Public Key: -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAv9+iXUFZISHlZfGrkio5

-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
API key for admin: r41crc30ys1hv3njzrvz30xq6k210ec4y61y5qmmj1xyb300btrxmer
```

> Note that the `conjurctl account create` command gives you the public key and admin API key for the account you created. Back them up in a safe location.

### Expose Conjur service

By default the Conjur service is not exposed outside of the GKE cluster.

To expose this service and be able to connect remotely, an external IP must
be exposed. To expose this IP:

```
kubectl patch svc "$APP_INSTANCE_NAME-conjur" \
  --namespace "$NAMESPACE" \
  -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
```

Note that it might take some time for the external IP to be provisioned.
Run `kubectl get svc "$APP_INSTANCE_NAME-conjur"` until the `EXTERNAL-IP` column resolves.

### Connect remote with the Conjur CLI

Now pull the latest [cyberark/conjur-cli:5 image](https://hub.docker.com/r/cyberark/conjur-cli/) and run it to connect to Conjur.

```
$ docker pull cyberark/conjur-cli:5
$ docker run --rm -it --entrypoint bash cyberark/conjur-cli:5

# conjur init -u [EXTERNAL_IP] -a quick-start # or whatever account you created
# conjur authn login -u admin
Please enter admin\'s password (it will not be echoed):
Logged in

# conjur authn whoami
{"account":"quick-start","username":"admin"}
```

### Next steps

- Go through the [Conjur Tutorials](https://www.conjur.org/tutorials/)
- View Conjurâ€™s [API Documentation](https://www.conjur.org/api.html)
- Secure the server with an [NGINX Proxy](https://www.conjur.org/tutorials/nginx.html)

# Scaling

This is a single-instance version of Conjur.
It is not intended to be scaled up with the current configuration.

# Upgrade the Application

## Prepare the environment

If you are using a remote database, no changes are needed.

The default postgres deployment does not persist data between upgrades.

## Upgrade Conjur

Set the new image version in an environment variable:

```shell
export IMAGE_CONJUR=gcr.io/conjur-cloud-launcher-onboard/cyberark:latest
```

Update the Deployment definition with the reference to the new image:

```shell
kubectl patch deployment $APP_INSTANCE_NAME-conjur \
  --namespace $NAMESPACE \
  --type='json' \
  --patch="[{ \
      \"op\": \"replace\", \
      \"path\": \"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image\", \
      \"value\":\"${IMAGE_CONJUR}\" \
    }]"
```

Monitor the process with:

```shell
kubectl get pods -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=$APP_INSTANCE_NAME" \
  --output go-template='Status={{.status.phase}} Image={{(index .spec.containers 0).image}}' \
  --watch
```

The Pod is terminated, and recreated with a new image for the `conjur`
container. After the update is complete, the final state of
the Pod is `Running`, and marked as 1/1 in the `READY` column.

# Uninstall the Application

## Using the Google Cloud Platform Console

1. In the GCP Console, open [Kubernetes Applications](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/application).

1. From the list of applications, click **Conjur by CyberArk**.

1. On the Application Details page, click **Delete**.

## Using the command line

Delete the application release using Helm:

```sh-session
